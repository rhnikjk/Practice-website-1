    <h3 class="ex">Currently MWll is in season five reloaded,(its seccond to last season) before MWlll, from the launch of MWll to now it has gone through many updates,changes and also its highs and lows.Many people were skeptical about MWll when it came out as it was extremely diferent to the old call of duty-(MW2019) some people even said that it was going to fail and movement was gone however only time would tell.</h3>
    
    <h3 class="ex">However 11 months later this is far from true MWll is now a lively and well respected game.MWll still gets complaints aqbout how the movement is but most people have got on with it and come to enjoy the slower play style and the new gamemode-DMZ.</h3>
